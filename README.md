# pylite (python)

Pylite is project started by @Tams-Tams in https://github.com/Tams-Tams/PyLite, and it is written in Javascript. 

So I decided to make a python implementation of it.

# Manual

(The project is unfinished)

* To print text use the `say` statement: `say "Hello, World!"`
* To define a variable you can use `def` statement. Everything should be enclosed in string, and they will be cast to their correct types in runtime: `def "abcd" "1234"` it will define a variable `abcd` with integer `1234`.
* To concatenate variables with string, enclose them in braces: `say "{abcd}HW{abcd}"` expands to `say "1234HW1234"`.
